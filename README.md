# Identifiability of Lettuce Growth Model

This repository contains matlab scripts and results related to the analysis of the lettuce growth model. The analysis includes studying parameter correlations, sensitivity analysis, and structural identifiability of the model.

## Scripts description

* **`script/sensitivity.m`**: Run sensitivity analysis. The results are visualized in `img/sensitivity.png`.
* **`script/correlation.m`**: Run correlation method. The results are visualized in `img/correlation.png`.
* **`script/run_sensitivity_analysis.m`**: Run the structural identifiability of the model using the Matlab GenSSI toolbox.

For a detailed discussion of the scripts and results, please refer to the document `report.pdf`.

## versions and tools

* MATLAB (Version 2024b)
* ([[GenSSI](https://github.com/genssi-developer/GenSSI)]) Toolbox
